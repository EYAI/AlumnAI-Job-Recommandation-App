Immediate management responsibility: Consultants have the opportunity to manage the case process and Associate team from day 1 (L.E.K. hires two undergraduates for every new Consultant).
Breadth of experiences: While our projects span most industries and services, our focus is strategy and M&A. Consultants typically work on ~6-10 projects a year, providing greater exposure across clients and strategic issues, as well as faster development of business acumen.
Fun, stimulating work environment: L.E.K. teams spend substantially more time in their home office relative to teams at peer firms, and we pride ourselves on a vibrant social culture, including case team events, office parties, non-profit involvement, and much more.
International exposure: Approximately one-third of L.E.K. projects involve an international component, which allows Consultants to work on international case teams or, if they choose, to relocate to international offices on either a temporary or a full-time basis.
Upward mobility: L.E.K. is a meritocracy with an entrepreneurial culture and frequent feedback. Promotion paths do not follow a strict timeline; we promote people as quickly as they develop.

QUALIFICATIONS

While we do not use a rigid checklist, we look for a combination of attributes that provide an excellent foundation for a successful career at L.E.K., including leadership, drive, intellectual curiosity, analytical ability, teamwork, and uncompromising ethics. Consultants at L.E.K. typically have MBAs and/or a number of years of relevant business experience.

We're starting by reinventing insurance, by rethinking the technologies that enable it, but our true goal is to build a platform that rewards people for driving well — creating safer roads with fewer accidents in the process.

Backed by impressive funding, we're poised to re-engineer a trillion-dollar category, and that’s just the beginning. We’re using rich customer insights, advanced technology and data science to build our cloud-native InsurTech solution, and other things we haven’t even dreamt up yet. We're out to change behavior and promote mindful living at a societal level. But the key to us being successful in our mission isn’t just about nailing the technology—it’s about hiring the talented people who can help us make a quantifiable impact in the world. We’re growing our world-class team.

And that’s where you come in.

The Role
The Sr. Lifecycle Marketing Specialist helps plan strategic communications and data-driven campaigns across channels and key touch points, including email, push notifications, SMS, and direct mail. Your role is responsible for the continuous enhancement of our email campaigns and customer comms to drive growth, activation, and increase customer relationships and loyalty while partnering closely with marketing and product teams across growth initiatives.

Working within the cross-discipline growth team, you will be responsible for planning, executing, analyzing and optimizing lifecycle strategies while serving as a subject matter expert for omni-channel communication. With an orientation around our target customer experience and generating measurable engagements that drive short and long-term business results. The ideal candidate has a data-driven analytical mindset, a passion for understanding the customer journey, and has worked on complex lifecycle and nurture programs.
About You:
You’ve travelled many roads within the marketing practice—from retail to ecommerce and SaaS start-ups—delivered results and helped grow a profitable customer base and kept them engaged with strategic and experimental growth tactics. But you’re not one to rest on your laurels or driven by an ego. Instead, your passion for your craft, curious mind, and desire to see your team succeed fuels a broad interest in marketing that delivers results.
You have an entrepreneurial spirit and thrive on helping shape capabilities within a growing business. And you can leverage all your passion and acumen to deliver results with your team — be it email campaigns that promote organic referrals or build personalized nurturing journeys that convert. When it comes to the brand and customer, you understand these impact our success as much as business optimization.

Key Qualities:

You’re a hybrid with a passion for performance-driven marketing and branding. You understand that creating great marketing requires experimentation and meaningful measurement to achieve business results. But you’re also a master of the marketing craft, understanding the brand, the industry and what drives purchase decisions—and ultimately acquires great customers with high LTV. Whether extending brand campaigns through communication channels or working with research teams to interpret performance results, you know firsthand how to bridge the gap between a business strategy and building a community of engaged and passionate customers. Which you’ve done repeatedly. And you know that it takes teamwork to do it successfully.
You're a fantastic communicator with strong technical acumen. Both within your team, and without, you have to be able to give voice to your vision, and present your ideas effectively and objectively. And you’re ready to listen and learn too. Importantly, you understand how to take an idea and implement it, because you have extensive knowledge of ESP and CRM platforms. One moment you’re teaching the team how to create CTAs that convert and the next you’re optimizing email templates for automated email nurturing journeys.
You're a low ego collaborator and competent leader. You understand that without a multidisciplinary team to give campaigns life, an idea is worthless. You understand how to bring the creative team and technical team together to work seamlessly as a well-oiled optimized marketing machine, because you are as much a conductor as a collaborator. You also recognize the need to take a particular path, as you understand what the data is telling us and can guide the team toward optimized results.
You work with energy and passion for your craft. Branding, technology and the analytics space are your lifeblood and you inspire your teammates and compel them to produce performance driven marketing. You want to work where you can help shape the culture and have the ability to build something with a group of like-minded individuals that share your passion.
You experiment strategically. You have the ability to deliver great work that also delivers on customer and business needs. You know from experience that being intentional with your approach and experimentation goes much further than random tests for the sake of testing. And you find optimizations that generate results that acquire, retain, upsell and cross-sell customers at the right moment in the lifecycle.
You keep it together. You’re a master housekeeper—organized, methodical and timely. That’s how you stay on top of everything. Specifically, you need to be able to map the engagement into a plan that the team can implement, measure and produce extraordinary results.
You’re an entrepreneur. And with an entrepreneurial spirit, you’re a confident self-starter that has a passion for growing teams, evolving processes, and most importantly culture. In other words, you don’t want to just be a part of the culture, you want to help make it. You recognize that great company cultures come from you and your teammates, your positive attitudes and hard work to shape and nurture healthy and successful companies.
